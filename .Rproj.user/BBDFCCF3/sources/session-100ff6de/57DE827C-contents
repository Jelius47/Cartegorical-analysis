library(epitools) # For odds ratio and relative risk
library(dplyr)    # For data cleaning and manipulation

# Step 1: Load the data
data <- read_excel("Births.xlsx", sheet = "Births")

# Step 2: Data Cleaning and Processing 
    data <- data %>%
      mutate(

# Choosen variables and why?
# Mother's hypertension status: Predictor variable (hypertension may influence birth outcomes)
# Birth Status: Outcome variable (normal or abnormal)
# These variables are chosen to analyze the relationship between maternal health and birth outcomes.

# Step 3: Chi-square test for independence
# Variables: Mother's hypertension status and Birth Status
chi_sq_table <- table(data$`Mother's hypertension status`, data$`Birth Status`)

# Step 4: Odds Ratio
# Variables: Mother's hypertension status and Birth Status

# Output Odds Ratio results

  cat("An Odds Ratio > 1 suggests that hypertensive mothers are more likely to have abnormal birth outcomes.\n")
} else {
  cat("An Odds Ratio < 1 suggests that hypertensive mothers are less likely to have abnormal birth outcomes.\n")
}

# Step 5: Relative Risk
# Variables: Mother's hypertension status and Birth Status
relative_risk_result <- riskratio(chi_sq_table)

# Output Relative Risk results
cat("\nRelative Risk:\n")
print(relative_risk_result$measure)

# Interpretation of Relative Risk
